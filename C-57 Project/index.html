            <h3>Hi Customers</h3>
            <p>
                I am Steve Jobs. A co-founder of Apple. The company we all know and love for asking people's entire life savings 
                in exchange for a phone. I am dead. But worry not, my friends are still alive and kicking to rob people's life savings.
                In exchange for a phone.
